# dotfiles

My dotfiles for the following programs:

- Alacritty, my terminal of choice
    I used to use kitty, but nowadays i prefer to use tmux over a windowing system
    built into my terminal emulator

- Neofetch
    Nothing special here

- nvim
    All my config is based off kickstart.nvim, mainly with some removals of keymaps
    I will never use
